# To-Do-List

I needed a simple to do list app and accompanying API so that I could display the tasks for the day on my [smart mirror](https://github.com/macsochor/Mirror/) I'm working on. My favorite to do list app doesn't have an API (really Any.do? Get it together) so I made my own using a simple firebase backend.
